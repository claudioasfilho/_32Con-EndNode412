# SoC - bt_AM_Conn_EN

The Bluetooth example has a custom service and three Custom Characteristics. 

It advertises as **"PeriDevxxxx"**, where the last 4 digits are the two last bytes of the device Mac Address.

It is meant to be used in conjuction to Central device: https://github.com/claudioasfilho/conn_interval_central_CI 

The Central device scans and connects to up to 32 peripheral devices which advertise a specific service "CCCC".

Once it finds the device, it will subscribe to notifications.

By Pressing PB0 it will start the test, where the Peripheral nodes will send a send a substantial amount of data and after the TEST_TIMEOUT runs out, the Central device will printout on the UART a report showing how much data was received from each connected node and its Upstream throughput.
